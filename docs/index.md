# Grabble is for Graphs
_A Tidier, Analysis-first Data Format for Networks_

## What is "a `grabble`"? 

The name is inspired by the R _tidyverse_'s **tibble**

> _**Gra**ph Ti**bble**_

As such, a `grabble` is meant to be a _tidy_ data structure (see REF), enabling a host of analysis and exploration _quality-of-life_
improvements for network analysts. 

> _a modern reimagining of **graph data structures**, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not._

Grabble is also a highly _general_ way of storing and manipulating graphs: it is intended as a _pivot_ format, that eases the transition from all the various formats for computationally representing graphs, while also making numerical
